# My Dotfiles

My current and evolving dotfiles. I currently symlink these to `$HOME` to the same directory structure.
* On Linux, `feh` is used to set wallpapers.
* Some of these are shared between Linux and macOS (neovim, kitty, powerline, etc.)
* .tmux.conf.local requires [oh my tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) to be configured as instructed in it's README
