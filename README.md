_I've migrated to using_ [Nix](https://github.com/Steven0351/nix) _for all of my system and user-level configuration._

# My Dotfiles

My current and evolving dotfiles. I currently symlink these to `$HOME` to the same directory structure.

- On Linux, `feh` is used to set wallpapers.
- Some of these are shared between Linux and macOS (neovim, kitty, powerline, etc.)
- .tmux.conf.local requires [oh my tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) to be configured as instructed in it's README
